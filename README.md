# Action2Graph

## About

A simple test of leveraging GitHub actions to perform transforms on data graph or other sources.  
Have seen several groups doing some interesting transforms on graphs or other data structures
into graphs.  Was curious what a repo using GitHub Actions looked like that could take input 
commits and then generate out the results.

This could, for example, be done on a CSV of sources that generates out a 
graph representation.  Or JSON-LD to other RDF serializations.
