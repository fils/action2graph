# TARQL

## About

This is just a few files I am using to test out [TARQL](http://tarql.github.io/) with.
The idea being to leverage SPARQL CONSTRUCT calls for converting CSV for the 
OIH organizations into RDF to address schema:Organization needs in the OIH graph.   


## Notes

Example command

```
 ~/bin/tarql-1.2/bin/tarql --ntriples test.rql test.csv
```
